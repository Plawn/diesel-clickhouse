# Performance Optimization

Analyze the provided code for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Conduct a thorough review covering:

## Areas to Analyze

### Database & Data Access
- N+1 query problems and missing eager loading
- Lack of database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Inefficient joins or subqueries
- Missing pagination on large result sets
- Absence of query result caching
- Connection pooling issues

### Algorithm Efficiency
- Time complexity issues (O(n²) or worse when better exists)
- Nested loops that could be optimized
- Redundant calculations or repeated work
- Inefficient data structure choices
- Missing memoization or dynamic programming opportunities

### Memory Management
- Memory leaks or retained references
- Loading entire datasets when streaming is possible
- Excessive object instantiation in loops
- Large data structures kept in memory unnecessarily
- Missing garbage collection opportunities

### Async & Concurrency
- Blocking I/O operations that should be async
- Sequential operations that could run in parallel
- Missing Promise.all() or concurrent execution patterns
- Synchronous file operations
- Unoptimized worker thread usage

### Network & I/O
- Excessive API calls (missing request batching)
- No response caching strategy
- Large payloads without compression
- Missing CDN usage for static assets
- Lack of connection reuse

### Frontend Performance
- Render-blocking JavaScript or CSS
- Missing code splitting or lazy loading
- Unoptimized images or assets
- Excessive DOM manipulations or reflows
- Missing virtualization for long lists
- No debouncing/throttling on expensive operations

### Caching
- Missing HTTP caching headers
- No application-level caching layer
- Absence of memoization for pure functions
- Static assets without cache busting

## Output Format

For each issue identified:
1. **Issue**: Describe the performance problem
2. **Location**: Specify file/function/line numbers
3. **Impact**: Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and explain expected performance degradation
4. **Current Complexity**: Include time/space complexity where applicable
5. **Recommendation**: Provide specific optimization strategy
6. **Code Example**: Show optimized version when possible
7. **Expected Improvement**: Quantify performance gains if measurable

If code is well-optimized:
- Confirm optimization status
- List performance best practices properly implemented
- Note any minor improvements possible
